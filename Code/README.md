# Kaggle-Word2vec
Solution for the Kaggle Data Science competition "Bag of Words Meets Bags of Popcorn"

https://www.kaggle.com/c/word2vec-nlp-tutorial

##Description
By learning from a list of already classified movie reviews, the algorithm needs to predict if a new one is either positive or negative. 

##Solution

###Input

####Labeled reviews
data/labeledTrainData.tsv

####Unlabeled reviews
data/unlabeledTrainData.tsv

###Parser
For both labeled and unlabeled reviews:
* Preserve relevant text
* Hashing trick (dimensions, wrapped words)

###Training and Clasification

####Algorithms:
* Naive Bayes
* Perceptron

####Steps
For each algorithm:

1) Train with labeled reviews

2) Clasify unlabeled reviews (give probability based on previous learning)

3) Define weight

Then, for each unlabeled review:

1) Calculate the normalized resulting probability based on weights 

2) Round probability to 0 or 1 (Negative or possitive)
